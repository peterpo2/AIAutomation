## 1. Introduction

SmartOps ("we", "us", or "our") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data.  
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard information when you use the SmartOps automation platform or connect third-party services such as **Dropbox**, **TikTok**, or **Firebase**.

By using SmartOps, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.

## 2. Information We Collect

### a. Directly from you
When you create an account or log in, we may collect:
- Name and email address (from Firebase authentication)
- Basic role and team information within SmartOps

### b. From integrated services
When you connect third-party services, we may receive:
- **Dropbox**: file names, file sizes, and paths (to manage uploads)
- **TikTok**: limited profile information and authorization tokens, used solely to upload videos on your behalf
- **Firebase**: authentication identifiers (UID) and login metadata
- **Supabase / PostgreSQL**: stores queue and analytics data related to uploads

We do **not** collect any unnecessary personal information or sell user data to third parties.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected data to:
- Authenticate users and manage team roles  
- Retrieve files from Dropbox and schedule video uploads  
- Post authorized content to your TikTok account  
- Generate analytics summaries and AI-powered performance insights  

Your data is **never shared** with external advertisers or data brokers.

## 4. Data Security

All data is encrypted in transit using HTTPS/TLS.  
Tokens and API credentials are securely stored in environment-protected variables and are not exposed publicly.  
Access to sensitive services (TikTok, Dropbox, Firebase) is restricted to authorized accounts only.

## 5. TikTok Integration

When you connect your TikTok account:
- SmartOps requests permission to upload videos and access basic account information (such as username and profile ID).  
- This data is used **only** to automate your approved video uploads.
- Tokens are stored securely and can be revoked by disconnecting TikTok or emailing us.

We never post content or access private data without your explicit authorization.

## 6. Data Retention and Deletion

We retain user data only as long as your SmartOps workspace remains active.  
You may disconnect Dropbox or TikTok integrations at any time.

If you wish to delete all associated SmartOps data (including TikTok tokens), please contact us at **privacy@smartops.test** â€” requests are processed within **7 business days**.
